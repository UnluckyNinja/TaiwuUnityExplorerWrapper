# UnityExplorerWrapper - A mod of *The Scroll of Taiwu*

[中文说明](./README.zh_CN.md)

Wrapped [UnityExplorer](https://github.com/sinai-dev/UnityExplorer) for better inspecting and debugging ingame.

## Installation
Download from Release, unzip to `/Mod` folder.  
(Beware that you should alwasy start the game from Steam or TaiwuLauncher.exe, or you will get errors.)
When enters the main menu, press **F7** to toggle its UI.  
In "Object Explorer", select "DontDestroyOnLoad" from the "Scene" dropdown. This is what you are looking for about every other game stuff you can see.  

## Development
Open VisualStudio and import the solution file.
Add references to the five following files:
- `TaiwuModdingLib`
- `UnityEngine`
- `UnityEngine.CoreModule`
    The three files above are from `/The Scroll of Taiwu_Data/Managed`
- `UnityExplorer.STANDALONE.Mono`
- `UniverseLib.Mono`
    The two files above can be downloaded from https://github.com/sinai-dev/UnityExplorer , under Standalone - Mono section. Unzip content to Non-game folder and add as references.

To test ingame, right click the solution and choose generate. Copy all output files and override the files (downloaded from Release) under `/Mod/UnityExplorerWrapper/Plugins`. (or you can add post-generation task to relieve your hands.)
